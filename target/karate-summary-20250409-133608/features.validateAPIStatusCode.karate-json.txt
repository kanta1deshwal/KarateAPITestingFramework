He is originally from <\/span><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\"><em>Muzaffarnagar<\/em><\/strong><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\"> district in the Indian State of Uttar Pradesh and resides in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. In his close circle, he is fondly called L.C. He is currently the CEO of TLC and holds multiple ownership interests across businesses in his portfolio.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">As an entrepreneur, his journey started quite early in life. He began as an educator and slowly expanded his business while going through ups and downs with a never-ending belief in himself. He established himself as someone who believes in going after what is required to sustain while with an attitude of never giving up.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">He is a \\\"man of commitment\\\" and follows his heart with a passion for bringing people up.<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Education:<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">He passed his 10th and 12th in 2005 and 2007.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">His commitment to Education was evident from an early age. By 2012, he had earned his master's M.Sc in Maths with a Gold Medal from Chaudhary Charan Singh University Meerut after already achieving a double graduate status with B.Sc and BCA at his bachelor's level. He didn't wait to start sharing his knowledge, embarking on his entrepreneurial journey at a young age.<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Early Career:<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">His journey as an educator began in 9th grade, in 2004, when he started academic coaching for his classmates. His knowledge and teaching skills quickly gained him a large following, marking the start of his journey towards his bigger dreams.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">From 2005 to 2009, he established himself as an educator whose classes were overflowing with students. From INR 6000 per month, he recorded millions within a few years. He was now expanding his academic classes from schools to computer coaching.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">In 2011, all this came crashing down when he suffered a significant loss of around INR 4 Cr in business, along with a major accident that got him bedridden for nine months on the path of recovery at the age of 22. The period of 2011-12 had its setbacks, but he bounced back after putting in his energy and never-say-die attitude.<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">After his recovery, which lasted a year, in 2013, he restarted his educator's journey with a fresh start with an academic coaching centre. As his students were learning, he wanted to bring Education to a larger group. For this, he joined hands with the Government's initiative of 2015, Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna, as a training partner in the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE).<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Under this partnership, Lavish was instrumental in setting up 87 academic training centres by 2018 in Uttar Pradesh with support from the Uttar Pradesh Kaushal Vikas Mission (UPSDM). These centres were aimed at helping underprivileged and eligible youth in the 14-35 age group in any sector with their selected courses.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">As growth followed, unfortunate incidents caused him a staggering loss of INR 9 Crore in 2018. Back payment delay and mounting expenses all came crashing down one day. This incident was a significant career loss after his first brush in 2011. He had to move back from the city to his village and give up his ancestral property to clear his debts while moving to a one-bedroom space with his family. By February 2020, he had losses amounting to INR 36 Cr. This duration was a time of test, and his parents were his biggest supporters. They trusted and believed in him to bounce back like he always does.<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">The Rise of the Phoenix: Entrepreneurial Journey<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Lavish has tasted success and loss in his eventful career, like every entrepreneur. In 2018, he started a financial startup, which helped him return to the game when the COVID-19 lockdown began. This time, it was a window for Lavish to refocus his energy on the future.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">From here, he expanded to Trading and Real Estate. By July 2021, he had recovered all his losses and was now gaining momentum with profits.<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">By the end of November 2021, he was a Venture Capitalist helping build startups across domains. His foray into Trading and Real Estate opened new doors. He brought A.I. integration, blockchain technology, and technological updates to the sector, which helped him cement his position.<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">From 2022, he was on a roll, expanding his business to Dubai and eventually moving to Dubai as an investor and entrepreneur. Under his Venture Capital brand, NuFi, he has invested in more than 65+ businesses across domains and helped them grow.<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Brand Portfolio includes:<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">As a venture capitalist, he has businesses spread across domains with full and shared ownership. He has been pivotal in harnessing ideas and helping young entrepreneurs achieve their dreams by sharing investment, experience, knowledge, and his network. Here are a few top names from his portfolio of brands. He is the Chairperson and Co-founder of these investments.<\/span><\/p><ul><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Lykans<\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Tap Tap Go<\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Ginni Social<\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Oonzoo<\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Medixa<\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">PulsePromote<\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">One Step (Corporate Service Provider)<\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Tech Matpatra<\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Atlanture Sports<\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Play Sports<\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">TLC<\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Mannat Development<\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">99Office<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p><br><\/p><p><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Lykans Realty<\/strong><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\"> is a premier real estate agency based in Dubai that specialises in luxury properties.

His first brush with Cricket started as a regular kid while he was in his 5th grade. At 13, a Cricket game changed his direction towards sports when he was tasked to make his team win an almost-lost match. The opposition required 50 runs to win, and with his bowling prowess, he could keep them at their crease and make his team win. After that match, he was called the \\\"game-changer\\\" with his inexplicable bowling skills.<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">By the 9th Grade, Cricket was his passion, and he keenly pursued it with a dream of playing for Team India. He regards two teachers, Saleem Sir and Rashid Sir, as his inspiration and motivators who propelled him into Cricket.<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">One exciting match during his school days, which he describes as the most challenging match of his life, was when he was playing against his juniors with his team. The catch was that only one team could play an official game at the state level, representing his school, so his principal put out a condition to select the best. The condition was that in a fiver-over match, if the juniors made half of what the seniors made, they would get to go as the official team. In Lavish's words, this was a \\\"make-or-break situation\\\". He hit 18 sixes and set a target of 132 runs that the juniors couldn't chase in time, thus cementing his team's position as the official winner of the match.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">By 2005, Lavish had established himself as an all-rounder in Cricket and, by turning 21 in 2011, achieved bowling speeds of 140 km\/hr.<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">He played and won \\\"Man of the Series\\\" for a Goa Premier League game. He was on the path to play for selections when he had an accident that shattered his dream of playing for the Indian Team. The same accident that made him bedridden for close to a year.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">But the future had other plans.<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">He was still keenly connected to sports and started ventures and events supporting talent. RKL (Real Kabbadi League) was one such event, with two successful seasons by 2022 in India.

As the aging population grows, the need for senior living spaces that promote independence, dignity, and well-being is becoming increasingly important. A self-sustainable senior citizens' home is one that minimizes its reliance on external resources, promotes eco-friendly practices, and fosters a sense of community, belonging, and empowerment for its residents. However, such a vision cannot be realized without the collective effort of local communities.<\/p><h4>1. <strong>Volunteering and Labor Support<\/strong><\/h4><p>One of the most valuable forms of community contribution is through volunteering and labor. Local construction workers, tradespeople, and enthusiasts can donate their time and skills to help build the physical structure of the home. This can include anything from laying foundations, building walls, installing plumbing, or electrical work. By reducing the costs associated with labor, the project becomes more financially feasible and can ensure that the resources are directed toward creating a safe, comfortable environment for senior citizens.<\/p><h4>2. <strong>Donations of Materials and Resources<\/strong><\/h4><p>For a self-sustaining home to function effectively, it must rely on renewable energy, sustainable water management, and eco-friendly building materials. The community can assist by donating building materials such as solar panels, rainwater harvesting systems, eco-friendly insulation, energy-efficient lighting, and sustainable construction materials like recycled wood or low-carbon concrete. Local businesses can play an especially important role by contributing supplies or offering discounted rates, making the project more affordable.<\/p><h4>3. <strong>Financial Support and Fundraising<\/strong><\/h4><p>Community-led fundraising events, crowdfunding campaigns, and donations are crucial to gathering the necessary capital for the project. Local businesses, civic groups, and individuals can contribute funds, helping to cover construction costs, purchase medical equipment, or provide funding for special needs, such as adapted transportation for residents or mobility aids.<\/p><h4>4. <strong>Educational and Emotional Support<\/strong><\/h4><p>Once the home is built, community members can contribute through social interaction, creating a network of support for the elderly. Organizing events, activities, or simply offering companionship will help make the home a vibrant, enriching environment where seniors feel valued and connected.<\/p><p>In conclusion, building a self-sustainable senior citizens\\u2019 home is a community endeavor that requires collaboration, innovation, and compassion. With contributions of time, resources, and expertise, we can create a space where seniors thrive independently and with dignity.<\/p><p>Your contribution will be highly appreciated<\/p><p>Regards.<\/p>\",\n        \"reposts\": 9,\n        \"complete_remark\": null,\n        \"created_at\": \"2025-01-16T13:53:47.000Z\",\n        \"publish_date\": \"2025-01-16T13:53:47.000Z\",\n        \"updated_at\": \"2025-04-04T13:05:10.000Z\",\n        \"deleted_at\": \"2025-04-04T13:05:10.000Z\",\n        \"status\": 1,\n        \"publish_status\": 1,\n        \"type\": null,\n        \"account_type\": 2,\n        \"address_line_1\": null,\n        \"address_line_2\": null,\n        \"address_line_3\": null,\n        \"state_id\": null,\n        \"city_id\": null,\n        \"district_id\": null,\n        \"pincode\": null,\n        \"longitude\": null,\n        \"latitude\": null,\n        \"keywords\": null,\n        \"visibility\": 1,\n        \"complete_status\": 0,\n        \"likes\": 1,\n        \"comments\": 0,\n        \"shares\": 0,\n        \"views\": 7,\n        \"support_status\": 0,\n        \"state_details\": null,\n        \"city_details\": null,\n        \"district_details\": null,\n        \"repost_data\": null,\n        \"user\": {\n          \"id\": 161,\n          \"first_name\": \"Manoj\",\n          \"last_name\": \"Sharma\",\n          \"user_profile_pic\": \"\/live\/salute-tiranga-24\/profile\/image\/26-12-2024\/676cf38e09da1-1735193486-ManojSharma-India-profile.jpg\"\n        },\n        \"help_me_categories\": [\n          {\n            \"id\": 212,\n            \"community_id\": 25,\n            \"help_me_id\": 273,\n            \"community_category_id\": 47,\n            \"category_id\": null,\n            \"other_category\": null,\n            \"status\": 1,\n            \"created_at\": \"2025-01-16T08:23:47.000Z\",\n            \"updated_at\": \"2025-01-16T08:23:47.000Z\",\n            \"community_category\": {\n              \"id\": 47,\n              \"category_id\": 8,\n              \"community_id\": 25,\n              \"module\": \"helpMe\",\n              \"other_category\": null,\n              \"status\": 1,\n              \"created_at\": \"2024-11-11T03:52:04.000Z\",\n              \"updated_at\": \"2024-11-11T03:52:04.000Z\",\n              \"category\": {\n                \"id\": 8,\n                \"name\": \"Social\",\n                \"module\": \"helpMe\",\n                \"status\": 1,\n                \"created_at\": \"2024-10-07T11:15:03.000Z\",\n                \"updated_at\": \"2024-10-07T11:15:03.000Z\"\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        ],\n        \"help_me_sub_categories\": [\n          {\n            \"id\": 242,\n            \"community_id\": 25,\n            \"help_me_id\": 273,\n            \"community_sub_category_id\": 8,\n            \"sub_category_id\": null,\n            \"other_sub_category\": null,\n            \"status\": 1,\n            \"created_at\": \"2025-01-16T08:23:47.000Z\",\n            \"updated_at\": \"2025-01-16T08:23:47.000Z\",\n            \"community_sub_category\": null\n          }\n        ],\n        \"content\": [\n          {\n            \"id\": 37298,\n            \"content_type\": \"image\",\n            \"content_url\": \"\/production\/lc-community-25\/help\/image\/13-11-2024\/67345cd2c2ffb-1731484882-lc-community-25.jpeg\",\n            \"content_thumbnail_url\": \"\/production\/lc-community-25\/help\/image\/13-11-2024\/thumbnails\/67345cd2c2ffb-1731484882-lc-community-25.jpeg\",\n            \"asset_id\": 10,\n            \"asset_type_id\": 273\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": 266,\n        \"user_id\": 161,\n        \"leader_id\": 25,\n        \"asset_id\": 10,\n        \"asset_type_id\": 266,\n        \"priority\": 1,\n        \"title\": \"Self Sustainable Sr citizens living\",\n        \"description\": \"<p>Dear Friends<\/p><p>With the changing environment and the sudden change in the societies structure the need for Sr citizen living has been felt as the family structure have moved from joint to nuclear families.

However, such a vision cannot be realized without the collective effort of local communities.<\/p><h4>1. <strong>Volunteering and Labor Support<\/strong><\/h4><p>One of the most valuable forms of community contribution is through volunteering and labor. Local construction workers, tradespeople, and enthusiasts can donate their time and skills to help build the physical structure of the home. This can include anything from laying foundations, building walls, installing plumbing, or electrical work. By reducing the costs associated with labor, the project becomes more financially feasible and can ensure that the resources are directed toward creating a safe, comfortable environment for senior citizens.<\/p><h4>2. <strong>Donations of Materials and Resources<\/strong><\/h4><p>For a self-sustaining home to function effectively, it must rely on renewable energy, sustainable water management, and eco-friendly building materials. The community can assist by donating building materials such as solar panels, rainwater harvesting systems, eco-friendly insulation, energy-efficient lighting, and sustainable construction materials like recycled wood or low-carbon concrete. Local businesses can play an especially important role by contributing supplies or offering discounted rates, making the project more affordable.<\/p><h4>3. <strong>Financial Support and Fundraising<\/strong><\/h4><p>Community-led fundraising events, crowdfunding campaigns, and donations are crucial to gathering the necessary capital for the project. Local businesses, civic groups, and individuals can contribute funds, helping to cover construction costs, purchase medical equipment, or provide funding for special needs, such as adapted transportation for residents or mobility aids.<\/p><h4>4. <strong>Educational and Emotional Support<\/strong><\/h4><p>Once the home is built, community members can contribute through social interaction, creating a network of support for the elderly. Organizing events, activities, or simply offering companionship will help make the home a vibrant, enriching environment where seniors feel valued and connected.<\/p><p>In conclusion, building a self-sustainable senior citizens\\u2019 home is a community endeavor that requires collaboration, innovation, and compassion. With contributions of time, resources, and expertise, we can create a space where seniors thrive independently and with dignity.<\/p><p>Your contribution will be highly appreciated<\/p><p>Regards.<\/p>\",\n        \"reposts\": 3,\n        \"complete_remark\": null,\n        \"created_at\": \"2025-01-11T06:03:03.000Z\",\n        \"publish_date\": \"2025-01-11T06:03:03.000Z\",\n        \"updated_at\": \"2025-02-13T10:22:37.000Z\",\n        \"deleted_at\": \"2025-02-13T10:22:37.000Z\",\n        \"status\": 1,\n        \"publish_status\": 1,\n        \"type\": null,\n        \"account_type\": 2,\n        \"address_line_1\": null,\n        \"address_line_2\": null,\n        \"address_line_3\": null,\n        \"state_id\": null,\n        \"city_id\": null,\n        \"district_id\": null,\n        \"pincode\": null,\n        \"longitude\": null,\n        \"latitude\": null,\n        \"keywords\": null,\n        \"visibility\": 1,\n        \"complete_status\": 0,\n        \"likes\": 1,\n        \"comments\": 1,\n        \"shares\": 0,\n        \"views\": 4,\n        \"support_status\": 0,\n        \"state_details\": null,\n        \"city_details\": null,\n        \"district_details\": null,\n        \"repost_data\": null,\n        \"user\": {\n          \"id\": 161,\n          \"first_name\": \"Manoj\",\n          \"last_name\": \"Sharma\",\n          \"user_profile_pic\": \"\/live\/salute-tiranga-24\/profile\/image\/26-12-2024\/676cf38e09da1-1735193486-ManojSharma-India-profile.jpg\"\n        },\n        \"help_me_categories\": [\n          {\n            \"id\": 205,\n            \"community_id\": 25,\n            \"help_me_id\": 266,\n            \"community_category_id\": 47,\n            \"category_id\": null,\n            \"other_category\": null,\n            \"status\": 1,\n            \"created_at\": \"2025-01-11T00:33:03.000Z\",\n            \"updated_at\": \"2025-01-11T00:33:03.000Z\",\n            \"community_category\": {\n              \"id\": 47,\n              \"category_id\": 8,\n              \"community_id\": 25,\n              \"module\": \"helpMe\",\n              \"other_category\": null,\n              \"status\": 1,\n              \"created_at\": \"2024-11-11T03:52:04.000Z\",\n              \"updated_at\": \"2024-11-11T03:52:04.000Z\",\n              \"category\": {\n                \"id\": 8,\n                \"name\": \"Social\",\n                \"module\": \"helpMe\",\n                \"status\": 1,\n                \"created_at\": \"2024-10-07T11:15:03.000Z\",\n                \"updated_at\": \"2024-10-07T11:15:03.000Z\"\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        ],\n        \"help_me_sub_categories\": [\n          {\n            \"id\": 233,\n            \"community_id\": 25,\n            \"help_me_id\": 266,\n            \"community_sub_category_id\": 8,\n            \"sub_category_id\": null,\n            \"other_sub_category\": null,\n            \"status\": 1,\n            \"created_at\": \"2025-01-11T00:33:03.000Z\",\n            \"updated_at\": \"2025-01-11T00:33:03.000Z\",\n            \"community_sub_category\": null\n          }\n        ],\n        \"content\": [\n          {\n            \"id\": 37173,\n            \"content_type\": \"image\",\n            \"content_url\": \"\/production\/lc-community-25\/help\/image\/13-11-2024\/67345cd2c2ffb-1731484882-lc-community-25.jpeg\",\n            \"content_thumbnail_url\": \"\/production\/lc-community-25\/help\/image\/13-11-2024\/thumbnails\/67345cd2c2ffb-1731484882-lc-community-25.jpeg\",\n            \"asset_id\": 10,\n            \"asset_type_id\": 266\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": 43,\n        \"user_id\": 161,\n        \"leader_id\": 25,\n        \"asset_id\": 10,\n        \"asset_type_id\": 43,\n        \"priority\": 1,\n        \"title\": \"Requirement of blood\",\n        \"description\": \"<p>There is an urgent requirement of B Postive blood gp in FORTIS hospital gurugram.

I would request the friends from my community to assist me in the areas mentioned below which will be beneficial for me in my growth .<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">Hydroponic farming, a term that blends&nbsp;<\/span><em style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">hydroponics<\/em><span style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">&nbsp;and&nbsp;<\/span><em style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">aquaponics<\/em><span style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">, is an innovative agricultural method that focuses on growing plants without soil. This farming technique relies on nutrient-rich water solutions and can be adapted for both small-scale and large-scale farming operations. Unlike traditional farming, which depends on soil for nutrients, hydroponic farming uses water to deliver all necessary minerals and nutrients directly to plant roots. In addition to its efficiency and resource-saving benefits, hydroponic farming also offers opportunities for local communities to engage in sustainable food production.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">However, for hydroponic farming to thrive, it requires active involvement from the community, especially in terms of knowledge-sharing, resource pooling, and collective problem-solving. This assistance can take various forms, from offering technical expertise and funding support to sharing local knowledge and volunteer efforts. Below, we explore some key ways in which communities can contribute to the success and expansion of hydroponic farming initiatives.<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><span style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">1.&nbsp;Educational Outreach and Knowledge Sharing<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">One of the major barriers to the widespread adoption of hydroponic farming is the lack of understanding about the technique. Community members with experience in hydroponics, aquaponics, or general gardening can play a pivotal role in educating others. Workshops, seminars, and hands-on demonstrations are effective methods for sharing knowledge about building systems, managing water quality, and maintaining nutrient levels. These activities could be organized in community centers, schools, or local agricultural fairs, where people can learn the practical aspects of hydroponic farming in a supportive environment.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">Experienced practitioners could also mentor beginners, helping to set up and maintain systems in community gardens or shared spaces, which would not only help spread the method but also promote food security and sustainability.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">2.&nbsp;<\/span><strong style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">Collaborative Resource Pooling<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">Hydroponic farming often requires significant upfront investment, especially for high-quality equipment like grow lights, water pumps, and nutrient systems. However, these resources can be expensive for individuals or small-scale farmers. By pooling resources within the community, it is possible to distribute the costs and make the practice more accessible to everyone. For example, a community cooperative could purchase shared equipment and then rent it out to members, allowing them to grow food in a more cost-effective manner.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">Additionally, local businesses might be able to sponsor or donate materials, such as organic fertilizers or equipment, to help kickstart the adoption of hydrophonic farming in the area. This not only benefits the individuals involved but also fosters a spirit of collaboration and local investment in sustainable agriculture.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">3.&nbsp;<\/span><strong style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">Support for Local Food Networks<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">Hydroponic farming can be an essential tool for enhancing food security and resilience in communities, especially in urban areas or regions with limited access to arable land. Communities can facilitate the development of local food networks by supporting small-scale hydroponic farms that provide fresh, locally grown produce. These farms can supply food to farmers' markets, co-ops, restaurants, and even schools, creating a direct link between the farm and the consumer.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">In addition, local governments and community organizations can offer policy support and incentives to encourage the growth of hydroponic farming. This could include zoning allowances for rooftop farms, grants for sustainable farming projects, or subsidies for water-efficient technologies.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">4.&nbsp;<\/span><strong style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">Volunteerism and Labor Support<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">Hydroponic farming, though less labor-intensive than traditional soil-based farming, still requires time and effort to maintain systems, monitor water and nutrient levels, and manage plant growth. Volunteers can play an important role in providing the labor needed for these tasks, especially in community-based projects or urban farms. Volunteers with diverse skill sets\\u2014from engineers to horticulturists to general laborers\\u2014can help with the design, installation, and maintenance of hydroponic systems, making them more efficient and effective.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">In return, volunteers can benefit from gaining valuable hands-on experience in sustainable farming techniques, which could lead to further career opportunities or personal growth. The act of volunteering also helps strengthen community bonds, as members work together to achieve a common goal.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">5.&nbsp;<\/span><strong style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">Networking and Partnerships<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">Lastly, successful hydroponic farming in a community often relies on building networks and partnerships with various stakeholders, including universities, research institutions, environmental organizations, and local businesses. Through these collaborations, communities can access new technologies, research, and market opportunities, further promoting the success of hydroponic farming.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29);\\\">These partnerships can also provide critical funding and grants for larger-scale community projects, such as urban farms or educational initiatives.

His knowledge and teaching skills quickly gained him a large following, marking the start of his journey towards his bigger dreams.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">From 2005 to 2009, he established himself as an educator whose classes were overflowing with students. From INR 6000 per month, he recorded millions within a few years. He was now expanding his academic classes from schools to computer coaching.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">In 2011, all this came crashing down when he suffered a significant loss of around INR 4 Cr in business, along with a major accident that got him bedridden for nine months on the path of recovery at the age of 22. The period of 2011-12 had its setbacks, but he bounced back after putting in his energy and never-say-die attitude.<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">After his recovery, which lasted a year, in 2013, he restarted his educator's journey with a fresh start with an academic coaching centre. As his students were learning, he wanted to bring Education to a larger group. For this, he joined hands with the Government's initiative of 2015, Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna, as a training partner in the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE).<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Under this partnership, Lavish was instrumental in setting up 87 academic training centres by 2018 in Uttar Pradesh with support from the Uttar Pradesh Kaushal Vikas Mission (UPSDM). These centres were aimed at helping underprivileged and eligible youth in the 14-35 age group in any sector with their selected courses.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">As growth followed, unfortunate incidents caused him a staggering loss of INR 9 Crore in 2018. Back payment delay and mounting expenses all came crashing down one day. This incident was a significant career loss after his first brush in 2011. He had to move back from the city to his village and give up his ancestral property to clear his debts while moving to a one-bedroom space with his family. By February 2020, he had losses amounting to INR 36 Cr. This duration was a time of test, and his parents were his biggest supporters. They trusted and believed in him to bounce back like he always does.<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">The Rise of the Phoenix: Entrepreneurial Journey<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Lavish has tasted success and loss in his eventful career, like every entrepreneur. In 2018, he started a financial startup, which helped him return to the game when the COVID-19 lockdown began. This time, it was a window for Lavish to refocus his energy on the future.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">From here, he expanded to Trading and Real Estate. By July 2021, he had recovered all his losses and was now gaining momentum with profits.<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">By the end of November 2021, he was a Venture Capitalist helping build startups across domains. His foray into Trading and Real Estate opened new doors. He brought A.I. integration, blockchain technology, and technological updates to the sector, which helped him cement his position.<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">From 2022, he was on a roll, expanding his business to Dubai and eventually moving to Dubai as an investor and entrepreneur. Under his Venture Capital brand, NuFi, he has invested in more than 65+ businesses across domains and helped them grow.<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Brand Portfolio includes:<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">As a venture capitalist, he has businesses spread across domains with full and shared ownership. He has been pivotal in harnessing ideas and helping young entrepreneurs achieve their dreams by sharing investment, experience, knowledge, and his network. Here are a few top names from his portfolio of brands. He is the Chairperson and Co-founder of these investments.<\/span><\/p><ul><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Lykans<\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Tap Tap Go<\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Ginni Social<\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Oonzoo<\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Medixa<\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">PulsePromote<\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">One Step (Corporate Service Provider)<\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Tech Matpatra<\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Atlanture Sports<\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Play Sports<\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">TLC<\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Mannat Development<\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">99Office<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p><br><\/p><p><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Lykans Realty<\/strong><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\"> is a premier real estate agency based in Dubai that specialises in luxury properties.

His first brush with Cricket started as a regular kid while he was in his 5th grade. At 13, a Cricket game changed his direction towards sports when he was tasked to make his team win an almost-lost match. The opposition required 50 runs to win, and with his bowling prowess, he could keep them at their crease and make his team win. After that match, he was called the \\\"game-changer\\\" with his inexplicable bowling skills.<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">By the 9th Grade, Cricket was his passion, and he keenly pursued it with a dream of playing for Team India. He regards two teachers, Saleem Sir and Rashid Sir, as his inspiration and motivators who propelled him into Cricket.<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">One exciting match during his school days, which he describes as the most challenging match of his life, was when he was playing against his juniors with his team. The catch was that only one team could play an official game at the state level, representing his school, so his principal put out a condition to select the best. The condition was that in a fiver-over match, if the juniors made half of what the seniors made, they would get to go as the official team. In Lavish's words, this was a \\\"make-or-break situation\\\". He hit 18 sixes and set a target of 132 runs that the juniors couldn't chase in time, thus cementing his team's position as the official winner of the match.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">By 2005, Lavish had established himself as an all-rounder in Cricket and, by turning 21 in 2011, achieved bowling speeds of 140 km\/hr.<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">He played and won \\\"Man of the Series\\\" for a Goa Premier League game. He was on the path to play for selections when he had an accident that shattered his dream of playing for the Indian Team. The same accident that made him bedridden for close to a year.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">But the future had other plans.<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">He was still keenly connected to sports and started ventures and events supporting talent. RKL (Real Kabbadi League) was one such event, with two successful seasons by 2022 in India. Atlanture Sports is India's emerging Sports and Entertainment Company, offering management of sponsorship, sports events, Athlete talent, and consulting.<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Personal Life:<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">His parents have a humble background.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">The father is a farmer who loves the ground, while his mother is a homemaker who cares for the family.<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><strong style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">Vision:<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\\\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(14, 16, 26);\\\">As of 2024, Lavish has set his eye on creating 2000 CEOs by 2027.
